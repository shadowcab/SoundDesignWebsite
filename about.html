					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<section>

						<p>
							Over the last 20 years, I’ve performed in various musical organizations including a music
							ministry,
							a metal/hard rock band, one instrumental trio, several classic and alternative rock cover
							bands, and
							a Beatles tribute band. From 2010 to 2012, as lead singer and bassist for the Orlando-based
							band
							Shadow Cabinet, we opened for such acts as The B-52’s, The Romantics, and Modern English.
							Currently,
							I’m attending Seminole State College for <code>web and mobile app development</code>.
						</p>

						<h4>A Brief Band History</h4>

						<p>
							Validium (Fig. 1) was my first successful band. We played about 8 gigs per month. Oddly
							enough, we started
							out as an "Open Mic" house band for a local night club. But soon, people only wanted to hear
							us jam! We
							were loud and ruckus! I miss those days the most.
						</p>
						<p>
							In Fig. 2, I’m on the right side, middle row. Those were the rough and tuff “biker bar”
							years. I was definitly
							"paying my dues" in those days.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’m the gentleman on the far left in Fig. 3. In Shadow Cabinet, I had finally graduated from
							smokey bars to classy restaurants
							and small concert venues.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2012, Shadow Cabinet opened for The B-52’s at the Amway Center! (Fig. 4)

					<h2>Final Thoughts...</h2>

					<p>Finding your signature guitar sound can be an adventure. Given all the technology
						available to the musician today, finding the right sound is mostly art with some
						science. Make as much music as your schedule allows, but listen even more. I
						will forever be a student of music and the guitar. Thank you for visiting my
						website. Peace.
