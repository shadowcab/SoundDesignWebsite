					<h2>Types of Effects</h2>

					<div>
						<p>
							According to <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/insync/time-based-effect/" target="_blank"
								rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweetwater Sound</a> (Time-Based Effect | Sweetwater, 2002), guitar effects fall into
								one of three
							effect types: Dynamic,
							Spectral, or
							Time-Based. <strong>Dynamic</strong> refers to those effects that affect the loudness or
							level of your guitar’s audio signal.
							<strong>Spectral</strong> has to do with augmenting the frequency profile of an audio signal
							and <strong>Time-Based</strong> effects involve
							changing some feature of an audio signal temporally.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although, Sweetwater Sound does not
							dive deeper or refine the definition of these categories, I think it's obvious that all
							effects have an affect on the dynamics and spectra of an audio signal and some effects
							process all three aspects with an impact on dynamics, spectra, and time. This means that
							the lines between these categories is blurred and they should be considered very basic
							and broad. In other words, many effects exhibit the characteristics of more than one
							category.
						</p>

						<h4>Dynamic Effects</h4>
						<p>
							Dynamic effects are effects that affect the loudness or level of your guitar’s
							audio signal. Volume pedals and compressors fall into this category.
						</p>

							Learn more about Dynamic effects <a href="dynamic.html">here</a>.
						</p>

						<h4>Spectral Effects</h4>
						<p>
							Spectral effects makeup the largest category of effects. It's comprised of any
							effect that augments the frequency profile of an audio signal. This category includes
							all Overdrive effects, Distortion effects (which is just a more aggressive overdrive),
							EQ effects, other filter effects, Wah Wah effects, and Pitch and Synth effects.
						</p>
						<p>
							Learn more about Spectral effects <a href="spectral.html">here</a>.
						</p>

						<h4>Time-Based Effects</h4>
						<p>
							Time-based effects are effects that change some feature of an audio signal
							temporally. Modulation, delay/echo, and reverb effects fall into this category.
						</p>
