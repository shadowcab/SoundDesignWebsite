					<h2>Spectral Effects</h2>
					<p>
						Spectral effects directly augment the frequency profile of a guitar audio signal. By
						emphasizing the mid-frequencies, a guitar solo can stand out in the mix. By adding
						addition harmonic frequencies, a guitar tone can sound fuller. The most popular spectral
						effect for guitar is the overdrive pedal, which pushes the amplitude of the guitar's
						frequency signature up to and past the point of distortion. Variations of overdrive and
						distortion create the sound of blues and rock guitar.

						<h4>Equalizer (EQ)</h4>
						<p>
							EQ allows a guitarist to change the character of their guitar sound by
							boosting or cutting the level of various frequencies or bands. Another popular
							use for EQ is to cut the frequencies that are causing feedback and prevent
							those frequencies from feeding back through the guitar amplifier.

								<p class="indent5p">
									The Boss Equalizer GE-7 is a 7 band graphic equalizer with effect level control.
									This EQ
									stompbox provides sliders to control 7 octave bands from 100Hz to 6.4kHz by 15dB up
									or down.

						<h4>Wah-Wah</h4>
						<p>
							A Wah-Wah pedal is a foot-controlled bandpass filter that is applied to your guitar signal.
							The pedal
							action is similar to an accelerator pedal of a car. As you rock the Wah footpedal, the
							resonant peak frequency
							is swept across the frequency bands from 350Hz to 2.5kHz. The net effect is a "waaah" tone.
							Jimi Hendrix's
							signature sound is from the combination of a Cry Baby Wah-Wah pedal and a Big Muff
							distortion pedal.

						<h4>Overdrive</h4>
						<p>
							Overdrive is a kind of soft or transparent distortion where the guitar's signal is raised
							towards the maximum level accomodated by the overdrive circuit. The result is raspy guitar
							tone which is popular in blues and rock guitar music.

						<h4>Distortion</h4>
						<p>
							Distortion effects can make your guitar sound like it's playing through an aggressively
							overdriven
							guitar amplifier without the need to play at high volume levels. The distortion effect is
							similar, but
							much more pronounced than an overdrive pedal.
