					<h2>Time-Based Effects</h2>
					<article>
						<h4>Modulation</h4>
						<p>
							Modulation effects involve one signal controlling or varying some parameterized
							characteristic on the guitar's audio signal. This process is called modulation.
							Modulation can make a guitar sound very surreal.
						</p>
						<div class="flex3col">
							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">Boss Super Chorus CH-1 Pedal</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									The Boss Super Chorus passes the guitar signal through a series of short delays that
									are
									modulated and mixed together to create a slight pitch variation. The net affect is a
									fatter, pulsating sound that sounds
									like multiple players are performing.
								</p>
							</div>

								</figure>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">User Controls</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									E.Level: The effects level sets the mixing level of the effect sound, which is a
									version
									of the original guitar signal with a varying pitch.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									EQ: This is a tone control for the effects signal.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Rate: This sets the rate of the "pulsating" chorus effect.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Depth: This sets the depth or pitch shift of the chorus effect.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</article>
					<br>
					<article>
						<h4>Delay</h4>
						<p>
							A delay effect creates a controllable echo effect by sampling the guitar signal and
							repeating it back a set number of times.
						</p>
						<div class="flex3col">
							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">Boss Digital Delay DD-7</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									The Boss Digital Delay is a compact stereo delay that offers modulation, analog,
									reverse, and "hold" delay modes.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div>
								<figure class="image_4">
									<img src="images/Boss_Digital_Delay_DD-7.jpg" alt="Boss Digital Delay"
										class="img_response_4" />
									<figcaption>Boss Digital Delay DD-7</figcaption>
								</figure>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">User Controls</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									E.Level (Effect Level): Controls the level of the effect sound.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									F.Back (Feedback): Controls the number of repeats.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									D.Time (Delay Time): Controls the delay time between repeats.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Mode: Sets the delay mode. Ordinary delay includes delay times
									from 1ms to 3200ms. Special delay modes include Hold, Modulate, Analog,
									and Reverse.
								</p>

						<h4>Reverb</h4>
						<p>
							Reverb effects create a variety of player-selected room reverberations for a guitar signal.
							The idea
							is to create the reverb ambiance of various spaces for your guitar sound.
						</p>
						<div class="flex3col">
							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">Line 6 Legacy Hall Reverb</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Line 6 Hall Reverb allows the user to configure seven reverb parameters: decay,
									predelay,
									low cut, high cut, mix, level, and trails(on/off). The reverb ambiance is that of a
									large hall space. The photo of the Line 6 Hall Reverb is only showing the display
									portion of the Helix floor
									processor. Click or tap on the photo to enlarge.
								</p>

									<figcaption>Line 6 Hall Reverb Parameters</figcaption>
								</figure>
							</div>

							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">User Controls</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Decay: The amount of time for the reverb tail to decay away. The longer the delay,
									the large the
									larger the room ambiance will feel.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Predelay: The amount of time before the reverb effect is mixed with the original
									guitar signal. This
									can help prevent your guitar sound from becoming muddy or too washed out.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Low Cut: Controls the amount of low frequencies in the effect signal. This can help
									prevent your guitar
									sound from becoming muddy or too washed out.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									High Cut: Controls the amount of high frequencies in the effect signal. This can add
									brighness or
									shimmer to the reverb tail.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Mix: Controls the amount of reverb effect mixed in with the guitar signal.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Level: Controls the level of the reverb effect.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Trails: This enables or disables the reverb trails on your guitar signal.
