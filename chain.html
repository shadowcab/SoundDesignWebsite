					<h2>Signal Chain</h2>

					<article>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>
							For our purpose, a signal chain is the path an audio signal travels beginning with the
							guitar’s output jack,
							through a series of active guitar effects stages and an amplifier, until it terminates,
							perhaps at a speaker or
							recording medium. Each stage offers an opportunity for a guitarist to modify or shape the
							guitar’s audio signal
							in some fashion.
						</p>
						<p>
							When it comes to creating your signal chain, the good news is there are no hard and fast
							rules. The order of your
							guitar effects is really a personal choice and if you believe as I do that music is a
							creative art, then the
							correct order for your effects (aka signal chain) is the one that works for you. However,
							you should really start
							with some general guidelines because there are many more self-defeating pedal combinations
							than there are good
							ones.
						</p>
						<p>
							That last statement is based on the fact that 10 different pedals can result in 3,628,800
							different pedal
							orderings. Prove it to yourself with MS Excel. Use the formula “=PERMUT(10,10)” which
							calculates the number of
							ways you can order 10 pedals without replacement. “Without Replacement” means that you will
							not use two or more
							of the same pedal in your signal chain…which is referred to as “stacking” and many players
							like Steve Via actually do stack pedals. In the YouTube video below, Steve Via talks about
							how he sets up his pedalboard (Musician's Friend, 2014).

						<h4>A Baseline Signal Chain with Options</h4>
						<p>
							To save time, I offer a Baseline Option (column 3) for ordering up to 20 different pedals.
							See Table 1. The baseline option follows conventional wisdom as far as the ordering of
							guitar effects.
						</p>
						<p>
							To use this table just position your effects in the relative order as specified in column 3
							or 4.
							You do not need to own every effect identified in the table. And if you only own one effect,
							be sure
							to place it before the amp or in the amp's effects loop. That is, any effect listed before
							the amplifier
							input (row 12) should be positioned before the amplifier and those effects listed after row
							12 should
							be positioned in the amplifier's effects loop if it has one.

							<em>*Volume Pedals can occupy several useful positions in the signal chain. You can boost
								the
								dynamics of your guitar playing by placing a volume pedal at the beginning of the chain.
								You can also place a volume pedal just before your modulation effects and use it to
								fade-in/out
								without attenuating the signal driving the other effects that rely on the strength of
								the
								audio signal.
								Otherwise the quality of your tone will change as you fade-in or out.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>**EQ Pedals can also occupy several useful positions in the signal chain, especially
								where you need to boost or cut certain frequency bands. Many effects have some EQ
								capabilities already built-in.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Looking at the tail of the signal chain in the table, conventional wisdom
							suggests that all modulation and time-based effects should be positioned
							in the amp's effects loop so those
							effects can create the ambience as intended with less extranous noise.
							Placing modulation and time-based effects
							earlier in the signal chain, especailly before distortion effects, may
							create an undesirable, muddy sound.
							If that is the sound you are pursuing, then go for it.
