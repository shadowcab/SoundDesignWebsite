					<h2>Introduction to Guitar Effects</h2>

					<article>
						<h4>In The Beginning...</h4>
						<p>
							Amplified guitars started appearing on the music scene back in the 1930’s to compete with
							the loud horn players
							of the big swing bands. But the organic sound of those early amplified acoustic guitars was
							thin and not very
							pleasing. Then in the mid to late 1930’s, Harold DeArmond invented the first commercial
							guitar pickup which
							paved the way for a variety of portable, standalone effects so players could create their
							unique sounds. As
							the story goes, DeArmond used a fret tapping technique to demonstrate the sensitivity of his
							pickup designs.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first commercially available standalone effects box was a tremolo unit invented by
							DeArmond and mass
							produced in 1948. By the late 1950’s, tremolo, vibrato, echo, and reverb guitar effects
							started appearing on
							the scene. Most effects at that time were made with vacuum tubes and built directly into the
							amplifier. By the early
							1960's, more portable, standalone effects units became available as transistors replaced
							bulky and fragile
							vacuum tubes. Guitarists were no longer limited to the fixed configuration of their
							amplifiers built-in effects. You can read more about the history of guitar effects pedals
							<a href="https://www.soundaffects.com/blog/2018/04/the-secret-history-of-guitar-effects-pedals/"
								target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> (Davies, 2018).
						</p>
						<h4>Motivation for Tone</h4>
						<p>
							Today, thousands of sound-altering devices are available for electric guitars in the form of
							effects pedals (aka
							stompbox) and multi-effects. Electric guitarists quickly discovered that guitar effects
							could
							be connected and
							arranged in an infinite number of ways to completely dress-up or down their guitar tone as
							appropriate for the
							music. Fat and silky or throaty and warm tones could be reproduced by modifying the
							amplitude and frequency
							content of their guitar signal. The shape of the audio wave form could also be transformed
							or
							translated into something
							very different and fresh.
						</p>

								target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this website</a> (<em>In The Studio: Recreate
								The Setups Of Classic Guitar
								Gods</em>, 2013) and discover how some of the
							greatest classic rock guitarists achieved their tone.
						</p>

						<h4>Types of Effects</h4>
						<p>
							Although, there are thousands of effects pedals on the market, they essentially fall into
							one of three effects
							categories: dynamic (like boosts, compressors, limiters, and noise gates), spectral (like
							EQ’s and enhancers), or
							time-based (which include echo, delay, chorus, flanger, phase shifting, reverb, pitch
							transposers, and
							harmonizers). I dedicate a whole section on the different types of effects
							<a href="types.html">here</a>. After a brief overview, you can then dive deeper into the
							separate types: dynamic, spectral, or time-based.
						</p>

						<h4>Signal Chain</h4>
						<p>
							An effect can be incorporated as a "stand alone" unit where your guitar connects to the
							input jack of the
							effect and an amplifier connected to the ouput jack. But the real fun begins when you
							connect multipe effects
							pedals into your signal path or signal chain. There are some general guidelines by which you
							can establish
							the intitial "order" of your effects. I've dedicated an entire page to discuss <a
								href="chain.html">signal
								chain</a> and how you can vary the order of effects to achieve different tonal affects.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Line 6 Helix is a professional grade multi-effects platform for guitarist and bassists.
							The display
							on the Helix depicts each effect as a box around a symbol. Altogether, these symbols or
							blocks and their
							connections represent the signal chain that the guitar signal will pass through. Each block
							represents a sound-altering device such as an effects pedal, amplifier, or speaker cabinet.
							An infinite number of guitar tones are possible
							based on what effects you choose and the order that you connect them together. See Fig. 1 -
							The Line 6 Helix
							Signal Chain.
						</p>

							</figure>
							<p> It's not unusual to connect two identical pedals in the signal chain and then dialing in
								different parameters on
								each. This is called "stacking" your effects and it adds a whole new dimension to your
								guitar tone. For
								example, some guitarists will place two distortion pedals next to each other in the
								signal chain. The first
								pedal is used to create a light overdrive effect at the point where the signal starts to
								break-up and the second identical pedal will be configured to produce non-transparent
								distortion
								with more sustain. Similarly, guitarists will use multiple delay effects to create two
								simultaneous but distintly different echo patterns which play off of each other.
							</p>

							<h4>Form-Factor</h4>
							<p>
								Effects come in various formats including single-effects stompboxes (Fig. 2),
								multi-effects
								(Fig. 3 & Fig. 4), rack-mounted, and software patches and add-ons that run in a Digital
								Audio
								Workstation (DAW).
							</p>
							<p>
								If you like experimenting with different effects and sounds, a
								multi-effects unit may cost less in the long run since they are usually packed with
								more effects than you can fit on a single pedalboard. Some also emulate several
								legendary amp and cabinet models for you to tryout.
