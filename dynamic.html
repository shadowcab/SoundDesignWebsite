					<h2>Dynamic Effects</h2>

					<article>
						<h4>Compressors</h4>
						<p>
							A compressor reduces the guitar's dynamic range. Dynamic range is the difference
							in dBs from the softest note to the loudest note played. By reducing the dynamic range, the
							volume
							level of harsh and peaky notes is automatically reduced and the level of soft, quiet notes
							is raised. The compression process will also make quiet notes sustain longer. The net affect
							is a
							tighter, pleasing sound. But too much compression can squash the sound, making
							the performance sound lifeless and dull.

								<h5 class="indent5p">MXR CSP202 Custom Comp Compressor Pedal</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									The MXR Custom Comp has three external controls (Output knob, Sensitivity knob, and
									footswitch)
									and two internal controls (Attack knob and Trim knob) that are located inside the
									case. It also
									features True Bypass so the effect doesn't affect your signal when turned off.

								<h5 class="indent5p">User Controls</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Output: Controls the output level.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Sensitivity: Controls the amount of compression up to 36 dB.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Attack: Only accessible from inside the device. Controls the reaction speed of the
									compressor before reducing the level. This allows the attack of the notes be heard
									before
									compressing.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Trim: Only accessible from inside the device. This is a high-end treble control.

						<h4>Noise Gates</h4>
						<p>
							A noise gate is a dynamics device that removes unwanted low-level noises from your guitar
							audio signal that fall below a user-set threshold level. Potential noise sources are
							single-coil
							guitar pickups and 60Hz hum from nearby power cables.
						</p>
						<div class="flex3col">
							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">Line 6 Helix Noise Gate</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									The Line 6 Noise Gate is a built-in, Line 6 Helix effects block. It can be
									configured
									for mono or stereo operation and provides controls for threshold, decay, and level.
									The photo of the noise gate is only showing the display portion of the Helix floor
									processor.

							<div>
								<h5 class="indent5p">User Controls</h5>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Threshold: Sets the threshold level where the unwanted noise is gated off.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Decay: Sets the delay in milliseconds from the time the threshold is triggered
									and the time that audio is gated off. This allows the threshold to be set lower
									so soft notes can be heard and to prevent quiet notes from getting abruptly
									cut off.
								</p>
								<p class="indent5p">
									Level: This sets the output level of the noise gate.
